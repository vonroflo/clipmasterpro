# ClipMaster Pro - Permissions Justification

This document explains why each permission is necessary for ClipMaster Pro functionality.

## Required Permissions

### 1. `storage` Permission ✅ **ESSENTIAL**

### 2. `clipboardRead` Permission ✅ **CORE FEATURE**
**Why needed:** Monitor and capture clipboard content automatically
**User benefit:** Automatic clipboard history without manual intervention
**Data handled:** Text content copied by user
**Privacy impact:** LOW - Only processes content user explicitly copies

### 3. `clipboardWrite` Permission ✅ **CORE FEATURE**
**Why needed:** Allow users to paste clipboard items back to system clipboard
**User benefit:** One-click restoration of previous clipboard content
**Data handled:** Previously stored clipboard items
**Privacy impact:** NONE - Only writes user's own stored data

### 4. `contextMenus` Permission ✅ **ENHANCED UX**
**Why needed:** Provide enhanced copy/paste options via right-click menu
**User benefit:** Improved workflow with contextual clipboard operations
**Data handled:** Selected text from web pages
**Privacy impact:** LOW - Only processes user-selected content

### 5. `activeTab` Permission ✅ **INTEGRATION**
**Why needed:** Enhanced integration with web pages for better clipboard monitoring
